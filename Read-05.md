## Heroku

> What is Heroku ? 

![maxresdefault](images/Heroku.png)


*Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we’re the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.*

*Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.[1][2] For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it has features for a developer to build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across most languages.*

> Installing Heroku 

*Once installed run the following command to login and verify that Heroku was successfully installed.*

`$ heroku login`


> Prepare The App

```
If you are new to Heroku, it is recommended that you complete this tutorial using the Heroku-provided sample application.   
```
[prepareHeroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#prepare-the-app)

*To clone a local version of the sample application that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:*

```
$ git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-getting-started.git
$ cd node-js-getting-started

```

> Deploy the app

*In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku by Create an app on Heroku*

```
$ heroku create

```
**Now Deploy THe Code**

```
$ git push heroku main

```

*Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name*

```
$ heroku open

```
> View logs 

*Heroku treats logs as streams of time-ordered events aggregated from the output streams of all your app and Heroku components, providing a single channel for all of the events.*


```
$ heroku logs --tail

```

`Control+C` To Stop Streaming

> Define a Procfile

`Procfile` *a text file in the root directory of your application, to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.*

*The Procfile in the example app you deployed looks like this:*

```
`web: node index.js`

```

> Scale the app

Your app is currently running on a single web `dyno` dyno as a lightweight container that runs the command specified in the Procfile. You can check how many dyos are running by entering:

`heroku ps`

> Declare app dependencies
*Heroku recognizes an app as `Node.js` by the existence of a `package.json` file in the root directory. For your own apps, you can create one by running* `npm init`


The `package.json` file determines both the version of `Node.js` that will be used to run your application on Heroku, as well as the dependencies that should be installed with your application.

When an app is deployed, Heroku reads this file and installs the appropriate node version together with the dependencies using the `npm install` command.

Run this command in your local directory to install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

`npm install`
